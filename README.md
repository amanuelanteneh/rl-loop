# Deep reinforcement learning for quantum state engineering of cubic phase states 

This is the supporting code for the results presented in the paper I co-authored *Deep reinforcement learning for near-deterministic preparation of cubic- and quartic-phase gates in photonic quantum computing* available [**here**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07859).
